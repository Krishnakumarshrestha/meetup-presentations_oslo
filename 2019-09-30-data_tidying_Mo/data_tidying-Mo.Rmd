# {tidyr} - to help you create tidy data.

[From the tidyr site](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/index.html)

** Tidy data is data where:** 

- Every column is variable.  

--

- Every row is an observation.  

--

- Every cell is a single value.  

--

### Tidy data describes a standard way of storing data that is used wherever possible throughout the tidyverse. 

---

### Data with values in column headers

.left-column[
The data set `relig_income` gives us some information about the income levels of households of different religions. 

Notice how the column headers are the income levels, and cell values are the number of households.

]

--

.right-column[
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
relig_income
```
]

---

### Data with values in column headers

.left-column[
We want the income to become its own column, and the frequency to be stored in a seperate column.

]

--

.right-column[
```{r}
relig_income %>%
  gather(income, frequency, -religion)
```
]

---

### Data with values in column headers

.left-column[
The new `pivot_longer` function was recently released with syntax that might be a little more understandable (and memorable!)

]

--

.right-column[
```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(-religion, names_to = "income", values_to = "frequency")
```
]

---

### Data with columns of repeated observations

.left-column[
The data set `billboard` gives us some information about top billboard songs vor various time periods. 

Notice how the column headers are numbers of weeks, one per song for the amounts of weeks that song was on the billboards.

]

--

.right-column[
```{r}
billboard
```
]

---

### Data with columns of repeated observations

.left-column[
We want the weeks to become their own column, and the weeks ranking to be stored in a seperate column.

]

--

.right-column[
```{r}
billboard %>% 
  gather(week, rank, starts_with("wk"), na.rm = TRUE)
```
]

---

### Data with columns of repeated observations

.left-column[
With `pivot_longer` we can also do the same, now with perhaps some more transparent arguments.

]

--

.right-column[
```{r}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "rank", values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
```
]

---
### Data with columns of repeated observations

.left-column[
We can even extent the `pivot_longer` function, so that week becomes an integer immediately. 

The alternative is to use a `mutate` function from {dplyr} after pivoting to do so. 
]

--

.right-column[
```{r}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), names_to = "week", 
    names_prefix = "wk", names_ptypes = list(week = integer()),
    values_to = "rank", values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
```

# {dplyr} - to alter and add to data

[From the dplyr site](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)

- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables.

--

- `select()` picks variables based on their names.  

--

- `filter()` picks cases based on their values.  

--

- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.  

--

- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.  

--

These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation “by group”. 


---

### Mutating data

.left-column[
If we go back to the billboards example we had before, and we don't do the step necessary to make `week` into an integer, we can alter (mutate) week to become an integer in a second step.

`mutate` is handy because you can use information from the data.frame it self to add or alter variables in the data.frame in a row-wise manner.

]

--

.right-column[
```{r}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "rank", values_drop_na = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  mutate(week = parse_number(week))
```
]

---

### Mutating data

.left-column[

The main {dplyr} functions also come with variants ending in `_at`, `_if`, `_all`, which allows you to do operations on multiple columns in a single step, as long as you want to do the same with all the selected columns.

For instance we can z-transform all the weekly rankings of all songs in one go.
]

--

.right-column[
```{r}
billboard %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("wk")), scale)
```
]

---

### Mutating data

.left-column[

We're going to use the `relig_income` dataset again, and use it in its untidy form, so highlight some cool things you can do with `mutate` and `select` .

Here, we use mutate to add a total row, and use `select_if` to select all numeric columns to create a sum of.

Then, we use `mutate_if` to alter each of the numeric columns, so they become a percentage
    
]

--

.right-column[
```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  mutate(total = rowSums(select_if(., is.numeric))) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, function(x) (x/.$total)*100 )
```
]

---

### Summarising data

.pull-left[

```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(-religion, 
               names_to = "income", 
               values_to = "frequency") %>% 
    group_by(religion) %>% #<<
  summarise_at(vars(frequency), 
               list(Mean = mean, 
                    Min = min, 
                    Max = max,
                    Sum = sum))
```

]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}

relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(-religion, 
               names_to = "income", 
               values_to = "frequency") %>% 
  group_by(income) %>% #<<
  summarise_at(vars(frequency), 
               list(Mean = mean,
                    Min = min, 
                    Max = max,
                    Sum = sum))
```
]

---

### Summarising data

```{r}
billboard %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(wk1, wk5, wk10, wk20, wk30), 
               list(Mean = mean, 
                    Max = min, 
                    Min = max,
                    Sum = sum),
               na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

### Summarising data


```{r}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(starts_with("wk"),
               names_to = "week",
               values_to = "rank") %>% 
  mutate(week = parse_number(week)) %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(rank),
               list(Mean = mean, Max = min, Min = max),
               na.rm = TRUE)
               
```

---

### Summarising data


```{r}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(starts_with("wk"), names_to = "week", values_to = "rank") %>% 
  mutate(week = parse_number(week)) %>% 
  group_by(artist, track) %>% #<<
  summarise_at(vars(rank),
               list(Mean = mean, Max = min, Min = max),
               na.rm = TRUE)
