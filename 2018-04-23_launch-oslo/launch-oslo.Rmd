# R-Ladies

- R-Ladies is a user-run group, meaning it is all of us that keep it going.

- Everyone is welcome to present something, no matter their skill level. 

- Presentations may be to showcase something you've been working on, to get feed-back on your approach or code, or just because you want to contribute and practise giving talks about coding.

- Everyone has something new to learn, and even a novice may have found an interesting way of doing someting an expert didn't think of.
